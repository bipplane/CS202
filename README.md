Course Exercise Solutions for CS202 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

### Synopsis
This course teaches students how to solve problems by designing efficient algorithms, and how to
analyze the efficiency of algorithms. Students’ earlier programming experiences, mathematics (discrete
maths and linear algebra), and the mastery of data structures are necessary for this course. The
materials as well as the assignments expect students to have proficient programming skills in Python.
Students will learn:

- The different paradigms of algorithm design such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming and
greedy algorithms.
- The analysis on the complexity of algorithms.
- Limits of algorithm design via the study of intractability including the reductions of given problems to
known problems and the knowledge of NP completeness and NP hardness.
- More modern algorithm design concepts such as approximation to achieve more effective problem
solving and more efficient solutions.

This course will go into the theoretical underpinnings of efficiency, algorithm correctness, and how
algorithm design has a basis in identifying mathematical properties of the problem.
